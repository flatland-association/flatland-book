    "Variable speeds reflect real-world trains running slower than their maximum allowed speed, either due to their physical properties (cargo vs. passenger trains) or due to reduced speed signalled by the Infrastructure Manager's safety system in order to ensure trains can stop within their allocated paths. Train driver's decisions to accelerate/brake also reflect resource optimisation (e.g. trains should wait and accelerator to run max speed through infrastructure bottlnecks) or energy optimsation (\"eco drive\")."
