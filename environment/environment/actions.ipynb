    "\n",
    "The trains in Flatland have strongly limited movements, as you would expect from a railway simulation. This means that only a few actions are valid in most\n",
    "cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the possible actions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`DO_NOTHING`**:  If the agent is already moving, it continues moving. If it is stopped, it stays stopped. Special case: if the agent is at a dead-end, this action will result in the train turning around. The train keeps the same speed. Special case: a symmetric switch in facing direction cannot be entered by this action.\n",
    "- **`MOVE_LEFT`**: This action is only valid at cells where the agent can change direction towards the left. If chosen, the left transition and a rotation of  the agent orientation to the left is executed. If the agent is stopped, this action will cause it to start moving in any cell where forward or left is allowed! The train keeps the same speed.\n",
    "- **`MOVE_FORWARD`**: The agent will move forward. This action will start the agent when stopped. At switches, this will choose the forward direction. In addition, the train accelerates by `RailEnv.acceleration_delta`. Special case: a symmetric switch in facing direction cannot be entered by this action.\n",
    "- **`MOVE_RIGHT`**: The same as deviate left but for right turns, keeping the same speed.\n",
    "- **`STOP_MOVING`**: This action causes the agent to decelerate/brake reducing speed by `RailEnv.braking_delta`. Special case: a symmetric switch in facing direction cannot be entered by this action, the train is stopped immediately instead of braking.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flatland is a discrete time simulation, i.e. it performs all actions with constant time step. A single simulation step synchronously moves the time forward by a\n",
    "constant increment, thus enacting exactly one action per agent per timestep.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Code reference\n",
    "The actions are defined in [flatland.envs.rail_env.RailEnvActions](https://github.com/flatland-association/flatland-rl/blob/main/flatland/envs/rail_env.py#L69).\n",

    "\n",
    "Variable speeds reflect real-world trains running slower than their maximum allowed speed, either due to their physical properties (cargo vs. passenger trains) or due to reduced speed signalled by the Infrastructure Manager's safety system in order to ensure trains can stop within their allocated paths. Train driver's decisions to accelerate/brake also reflect resource optimisation (e.g. trains should wait and accelerator to run max speed through infrastructure bottlnecks) or energy optimsation (\"eco drive\")."
