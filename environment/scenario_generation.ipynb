    "You can see that you now need both a `rail_generator` and a `line_generator` to generate a level. These need to work nicely together. The `rail_generator` will generate the railway infrastructure and provide hints to the `line_generator` about where to place agents. The `line_generator` will then generate a Line by placing agents at different train stations and providing them with individual targets.\n",
