Reinforcement Learning
======================

Both RLlib and PettingZoo environment wrappers are [Gymnasium](https://gymnasium.farama.org/)-compatible.
Gymnasium is a maintained fork of OpenAIâ€™s Gym library. The Gymnasium interface is simple, pythonic, and capable of representing general RL problems, and has
a [compatibility wrapper](https://gymnasium.farama.org/introduction/gym_compatibility/) for old Gym environments.

RLlib
-----
We provide a Flatland wrapper for ray RLlib multi-agent environment (https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/rllib/multi-agent-envs.html).

RLlib is an open source library for reinforcement learning (RL), offering support for production-level, highly scalable, and fault-tolerant RL workloads, while
maintaining simple and unified APIs for a large variety of industry applications

ðŸ”¬See [Flatland RLlib Demo](rl/rllib_demo).

PettingZoo
----------
We Provider a Flatland wrapper for PettingZoo parallel API (https://pettingzoo.farama.org/api/parallel/) for environments where all agents have simultaneous
actions and observations.
This API is based around the paradigm of Partially Observable Stochastic Games (POSGs) and the details are similar to RLlibâ€™s MultiAgent environment
specification,
except it allows for different observation and action spaces between the agents.
