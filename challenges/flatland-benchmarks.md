Flatland Benchmarks
===================


Flatland 3 Benchmarks are hosted at [fab.flatland.cloud](https://fab.flatland.cloud).
Flatland 3 Benchmarks follow up on the [Flatland 3 Challenge](https://flatland-association.github.io/flatland-book/challenges/flatland3.html).
More precisely, Flatland 3 Benchmarks follow Flatland 3 Challenge's
[Round 2 Environment Configurations](https://flatland-association.github.io/flatland-book/challenges/flatland3/envconfig.html#round-2), having the same
environment configuration but generated with different seeds.

[Flatland Benchmarks](https://github.com/flatland-association/flatland-benchmarks) (FAB) is an open-source web-based platform for running Benchmarks to foster
Open Research.

Have a look at the [starterkit](https://github.com/flatland-association/flatland-benchmarks-f3-starterkit) for participating in the benchmarks, featuring a
random agent.

There is also at [heuristic baseline](https://github.com/flatland-association/flatland-benchmarks-f3-deadlock-avoidance-baseline), aiming at avoiding deadlocks.
